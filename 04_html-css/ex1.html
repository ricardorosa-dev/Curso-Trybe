    <h1>Life, Life</h1>
    <p>I don't believe in omens or fear<br> Forebodings. I flee from neither slander<br> Nor from poison. Death does not exist.<br> Everyone's immortal. Everything is too.<br> No point in fearing death at seventeen,<br> Or seventy. There's only here and
        now, and light;<br> Neither death, nor darkness, exists.<br> We're all already on the seashore;<br> I'm one of those who'll be hauling in the nets<br> When a shoal of immortality swims by.<br><br> Arseny Tarkovsky
